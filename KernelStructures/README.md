# Internal `system` structures of the Linux kernel

This is not usual chapter of `linux-insides`. As you may understand from the title, it mostly describes
internal `system` structures of the Linux kernel. Like `Interrupt Descriptor Table`, `Global Descriptor
Table` and many many more.

Most of information is taken from official [Intel](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html) and [AMD](http://developer.amd.com/resources/developer-guides-manuals/) manuals.
