# Interrupts and Interrupt Handling

You will find a couple of posts which describes an interrupts and an exceptions handling in the linux kernel.

* [Interrupts and Interrupt Handling. Part 1.](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/interrupts/interrupts-1.md) - describes an interrupts handling theory.
* [Start to dive into interrupts in the Linux kernel](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/interrupts/interrupts-2.md) - this part starts to describe interrupts and exceptions handling related stuff from the early stage.
* [Early interrupt handlers](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/interrupts/interrupts-3.md) - third part describes early interrupt handlers.
* [Interrupt handlers](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/interrupts/interrupts-4.md) - fourth part describes first non-early interrupt handlers.
* [Implementation of exception handlers](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/interrupts/interrupts-5.md) - descripbes implementation of some exception handlers as double fault, divide by zero and etc.
