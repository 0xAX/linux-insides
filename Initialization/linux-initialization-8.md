Kernel initialization. Part 8.
================================================================================

Scheduler initialization
================================================================================

This is the eighth [part](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Initialization/index.html) of the Linux kernel initialization process and we stopped on the `setup_nr_cpu_ids` function in the [previous](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/Initialization/linux-initialization-7.md) part. The main point of the current part is [scheduler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_%28computing%29) initialization. But before we will start to learn initialization process of the scheduler, we need to do some stuff. The next step in the [init/main.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/init/main.c) is the `setup_per_cpu_areas` function. This function setups areas for the `percpu` variables, more about it you can read in the special part about the [Per-CPU variables](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Concepts/per-cpu.html). After `percpu` areas up and running, the next step is the `smp_prepare_boot_cpu` function. This function does some preparations for the [SMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing):

```C
static inline void smp_prepare_boot_cpu(void)
{
         smp_ops.smp_prepare_boot_cpu();
}
```

where the `smp_prepare_boot_cpu` expands to the call of the `native_smp_prepare_boot_cpu` function (more about `smp_ops` will be in the special parts about `SMP`):

```C
void __init native_smp_prepare_boot_cpu(void)
{
        int me = smp_processor_id();
        switch_to_new_gdt(me);
        cpumask_set_cpu(me, cpu_callout_mask);
        per_cpu(cpu_state, me) = CPU_ONLINE;
}
```

The `native_smp_prepare_boot_cpu` function gets the number of the current CPU (which is Bootstrap processor and its `id` is zero) with the `smp_processor_id` function. I will not explain how the `smp_processor_id` works, because we alread saw it in the [Kernel entry point](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Initialization/linux-initialization-4.html) part. As we got processor `id` number we reload [Global Descriptor Table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table) for the given CPU with the `switch_to_new_gdt` function:

```C
void switch_to_new_gdt(int cpu)
{
        struct desc_ptr gdt_descr;

        gdt_descr.address = (long)get_cpu_gdt_table(cpu);
        gdt_descr.size = GDT_SIZE - 1;
        load_gdt(&gdt_descr);
        load_percpu_segment(cpu);
}
```

The `gdt_descr` variable represents pointer to the `GDT` descriptor here (we already saw `desc_ptr` in the [Early interrupt and exception handling](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Initialization/linux-initialization-2.html)). We get the address and the size of the `GDT` descriptor where `GDT_SIZE` is `256` or:

```C
#define GDT_SIZE (GDT_ENTRIES * 8)
```

and the address of the descriptor we will get with the `get_cpu_gdt_table`:

```C
static inline struct desc_struct *get_cpu_gdt_table(unsigned int cpu)
{
        return per_cpu(gdt_page, cpu).gdt;
}
```

The `get_cpu_gdt_table` uses `per_cpu` macro for getting `gdt_page` percpu variable for the given CPU number (bootstrap processor with `id` - 0 in our case). You can ask the following question: so, if we can access `gdt_page` percpu variable, where it was defined? Actually we alread saw it in this book. If you have read the first [part](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Initialization/linux-initialization-1.html) of this chapter, you can remember that we saw definition of the `gdt_page` in the [arch/x86/kernel/head_64.S](https://github.com/0xAX/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/kernel/head_64.S):

```assembly
early_gdt_descr:
	.word	GDT_ENTRIES*8-1
early_gdt_descr_base:
	.quad	INIT_PER_CPU_VAR(gdt_page)
```

and if we will look on the [linker](https://github.com/0xAX/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S) file we can see that it locates after the `__per_cpu_load` symbol:

```C
#define INIT_PER_CPU(x) init_per_cpu__##x = x + __per_cpu_load
INIT_PER_CPU(gdt_page);
```

and filled `gdt_page` in the [arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c#L94):

```C
DEFINE_PER_CPU_PAGE_ALIGNED(struct gdt_page, gdt_page) = { .gdt = {
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64
	[GDT_ENTRY_KERNEL32_CS]		= GDT_ENTRY_INIT(0xc09b, 0, 0xfffff),
	[GDT_ENTRY_KERNEL_CS]		= GDT_ENTRY_INIT(0xa09b, 0, 0xfffff),
	[GDT_ENTRY_KERNEL_DS]		= GDT_ENTRY_INIT(0xc093, 0, 0xfffff),
	[GDT_ENTRY_DEFAULT_USER32_CS]	= GDT_ENTRY_INIT(0xc0fb, 0, 0xfffff),
	[GDT_ENTRY_DEFAULT_USER_DS]	= GDT_ENTRY_INIT(0xc0f3, 0, 0xfffff),
	[GDT_ENTRY_DEFAULT_USER_CS]	= GDT_ENTRY_INIT(0xa0fb, 0, 0xfffff),
    ...
    ...
    ...
```

more about `percpu` variables you can read in the [Per-CPU variables](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Concepts/per-cpu.html) part. As we got address and size of the `GDT` descriptor we case reload `GDT` with the `load_gdt` which just execute `lgdt` instruct and load `percpu_segment` with the following function:

```C
void load_percpu_segment(int cpu) {
    loadsegment(gs, 0);
    wrmsrl(MSR_GS_BASE, (unsigned long)per_cpu(irq_stack_union.gs_base, cpu));
    load_stack_canary_segment();
}
```

The base address of the `percpu` area must contain `gs` register (or `fs` register for `x86`), so we are using `loadsegment` macro and pass `gs`. In the next step we writes the base address if the [IRQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_request_%28PC_architecture%29) stack and setup stack [canary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow_protection) (this is only for `x86_32`). After we load new `GDT`, we fill `cpu_callout_mask` bitmap with the current cpu and set cpu state as online with the setting `cpu_state` percpu variable for the current processor - `CPU_ONLINE`:

```C
cpumask_set_cpu(me, cpu_callout_mask);
per_cpu(cpu_state, me) = CPU_ONLINE;
```

So, what is it `cpu_callout_mask` bitmap... As we initialized bootstrap processor (procesoor which is booted the first on `x86`) the other processors in a multiprocessor system are known as `secondary processors`. Linux kernel uses two following bitmasks:

* `cpu_callout_mask`
* `cpu_callin_mask`

After bootstrap processor initialized, it updates the `cpu_callout_mask` to indicate which secondary processor can be initialized next. All other or secondary processors can do some initialization stuff before and check the `cpu_callout_mask` on the boostrap processor bit. Only after the bootstrap processor filled the `cpu_callout_mask` this secondary processor, it will continue the rest of its initialization. After that the certain processor will finish its initialization process, the processor sets bit in the `cpu_callin_mask`. Once the bootstrap processor finds the bit in the `cpu_callin_mask` for the current secondary processor, this processor repeats the same procedure for initialization of the rest of a secondary processors. In a short words it works as i described, but more details we will see in the chapter about `SMP`.
        
That's all. We did all `SMP` boot preparation.

Build zonelists
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the next step we can see the call of the `build_all_zonelists` function. This function sets up the order of zones that allocations are preferred from. What are zones and what's order we will understand now. For the start let's see how linux kernel considers physical memory. Physical memory may be arranged into banks which are called - `nodes`. If you has no hardware with support for `NUMA`, you will see only one node:

```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/node/node0/numastat 
numa_hit 72452442
numa_miss 0
numa_foreign 0
interleave_hit 12925
local_node 72452442
other_node 0
```

Every `node` presented by the `struct pglist data` in the linux kernel. Each node devided into a number of special blocks which are called - `zones`. Every zone presented by the `zone struct` in the linux kernel and has one of the type:

* `ZONE_DMA` - 0-16M;
* `ZONE_DMA32` - used for 32 bit devices that can only do DMA areas below 4G;
* `ZONE_NORMAL` - all RAM from the 4GB on the `x86_64`;
* `ZONE_HIGHMEM` - absent on the `x86_64`;
* `ZONE_MOVABLE` - zone which contains movable pages.

which are presented by the `zone_type` enum. Information about zones we can get with the:

```
$ cat /proc/zoneinfo
Node 0, zone      DMA
  pages free     3975
        min      3
        low      3
        ...
        ...
Node 0, zone    DMA32
  pages free     694163
        min      875
        low      1093
        ...
        ...
Node 0, zone   Normal
  pages free     2529995
        min      3146
        low      3932
        ...
        ...
```

As I wrote above all nodes are described with the `pglist_data` or `pg_data_t` structure in memory. This structure defined in the [include/linux/mmzone.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/mmzone.h). The `build_all_zonelists` function from the [mm/page_alloc.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/mm/page_alloc.c) constructs an ordered `zonelist` (of different zones `DMA`, `DMA32`, `NORMAL`, `HIGH_MEMORY`, `MOVABLE`) which specifies the zones/nodes to visit when a selected `zone` or `node` cannot satisfy the allocation request. That's all. More about `NUMA` and multiprocessor systems will be in the special part.

The rest of the stuff before scheduler initialization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we will start to dive into linux kernel scheduler initialization process we must to do a couple of things. The fisrt thing is the `page_alloc_init` function from the [mm/page_alloc.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/mm/page_alloc.c). This function looks pretty easy:

```C
void __init page_alloc_init(void)
{
        hotcpu_notifier(page_alloc_cpu_notify, 0);
}
```

and initializes handler for the `CPU` [hotplug](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-hotplug.txt). Of course the `hotcpu_notifier` depends on the 
`CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU` configuration option and if this option is set, it just calls `cpu_notifier` macro which expands to the call of the `register_cpu_notifier` which adds hotplug cpu handler (`page_alloc_cpu_notify` in our case).

After this we can see the kernel command line in the initialization output:

![kernel command line](http://oi58.tinypic.com/2m7vz10.jpg)

And a couple of functions as `parse_early_param` and `parse_args` which are handles linux kernel command line. You can remember that we already saw the call of the `parse_early_param` function in the sixth [part](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Initialization/linux-initialization-6.html) of the kernel initialization chapter, so why we call it again? Answer is simple: we call this function in the architecture-specific code (`x86_64` in our case), but not all architecture calls this function. And we need in the call of the second function `parse_args` to parse and handle non-early command line arguments.

In the next step we can see the call of the `jump_label_init` from the [kernel/jump_label.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/jump_label.c). and initializes [jump label](https://lwn.net/Articles/412072/).

After this we can see the call of the `setup_log_buf` function which setups the [printk](http://www.makelinux.net/books/lkd2/ch18lev1sec3) log buffer. We already saw this function in the seventh [part](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Initialization/linux-initialization-7.html) of the linux kernel initialization process chapter.

PID hash initialization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next is `pidhash_init` function. As you know an each process has assigned unique number which called - `process identification number` or `PID`. Each process generated with fork or clone is automatically assigned a new unique `PID` value by the kernel. The management of `PIDs` centered around the two special data structures: `struct pid` and `struct upid`. First structure represents information about a `PID` in the kernel. The second structure represents the information that is visible in a specific namespace. All `PID` instances stored in the special hash table:

```C
static struct hlist_head *pid_hash;
```

This hash table is used to find the pid instance that belongs to a numeric `PID` value. So, `pidhash_init` initializes this hash. In the start of the `pidhash_init` function we can see the call of the `alloc_large_system_hash`:

```C
pid_hash = alloc_large_system_hash("PID", sizeof(*pid_hash), 0, 18,
                                   HASH_EARLY | HASH_SMALL,
                                   &pidhash_shift, NULL,
                                   0, 4096);
```

The number of elements of the `pid_hash` depends on the `RAM` configuration, but it can be between `2^4` and `2^12`. The `pidhash_init` computes the size
and allocates the required storage (which is `hlist` in our case - the same as [doubly linked list](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/DataStructures/dlist.html), but contains one pointer instead on the [struct hlist_head](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/types.h)]. The `alloc_large_system_hash` function allocates a large system hash table with `memblock_virt_alloc_nopanic` if we pass `HASH_EARLY` flag (as it in our case) or with `__vmalloc` if we did no pass this flag.

The result we can see in the `dmesg` output:

```
$ dmesg | grep hash
[    0.000000] PID hash table entries: 4096 (order: 3, 32768 bytes)
...
...
...
```

That's all. The rest of the stuff before scheduler initialization is the following functions: `vfs_caches_init_early` does early initialization of the [virtual file system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system) (more about it will be in the chapter which will describe virtual file system), `sort_main_extable` sorts the kernel's built-in exception table entries which are between `__start___ex_table` and `__stop___ex_table,`, and `trap_init` initializies trap handlers (morea about last two function we will know in the separate chapter about interrupts).

The last step before the scheduler initialization is initialization of the memory manager with the `mm_init` function from the [init/main.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/init/main.c). As we can see, the `mm_init` function initializes different part of the linux kernel memory manager:

```C
page_ext_init_flatmem();
mem_init();
kmem_cache_init();
percpu_init_late();
pgtable_init();
vmalloc_init();
```

The first is `page_ext_init_flatmem` depends on the `CONFIG_SPARSEMEM` kernel configuration option and initializes extended data per page handling. The `mem_init` releases all `bootmem`, the `kmem_cache_init` initializes kernel cache, the `percpu_init_late` - replaces `percpu` chunks with those allocated by [slub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLUB_%28software%29), the `pgtable_init` - initilizes the `vmalloc_init` - initializes `vmalloc`. Please, **NOTE** that we will not dive into details about all of these functions and concepts, but we will see all of they it in the [Linux kernem memory manager](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/mm/index.html) chapter.

That's all. Now we can look on the `scheduler`.

Scheduler initialization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And now we came to the main purpose of this part - initialization of the task scheduler. I want to say again as I did it already many times, you will not see the full explanation of the scheduler here, there will be special chapter about this. Ok, next point is the `sched_init` function from the [kernel/sched/core.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/sched/core.c) and as we can understand from the function's name, it initializes scheduler. Let's start to dive in this function and try to understand how the scheduler initialized. At the start of the `sched_init` function we can see the following code:

```C
#ifdef CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED
         alloc_size += 2 * nr_cpu_ids * sizeof(void **);
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED
         alloc_size += 2 * nr_cpu_ids * sizeof(void **);
#endif
```

First of all we can see two configuration options here:

* `CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED`
* `CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED`

Both of this options provide two different planning models. As we can read from the [documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/scheduler/sched-design-CFS.txt), the current scheduler - `CFS` or `Completely Fair Scheduler` used a simple concept. It models process scheduling as if the system had an ideal multitasking processor where each process would receive `1/n` processor time, where `n` is the number of the runnable processes. The scheduler uses the special set of rules used. These rules determine when and how to select a new process to run and they are called `scheduling policy`. The Completely Fair Scheduler supports following `normal` or `non-real-time` scheduling policies: `SCHED_NORMAL`, `SCHED_BATCH` and `SCHED_IDLE`. The `SCHED_NORMAL` is used for the most normal applications, the amount of cpu each process consumes is mostly determined by the [nice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_%28Unix%29) value, the `SCHED_BATCH` used for the 100% non-interactive tasks and the `SCHED_IDLE` runs tasks only when the processor has not to run anything besides this task. The `real-time` policies are also supported for the time-critial applications: `SCHED_FIFO` and `SCHED_RR`. If you've read something about the Linux kernel scheduler, you can know that it is modular. It means that it supports different algorithms to schedule different types of processes. Usually this modularity is called `scheduler classes`. These modules encapsulate scheduling policy details and are handled by the scheduler core without the core code assuming too much about them. 


Now let's back to the our code and look on the two configuration options `CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED` and `CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED`. The scheduler operates on an individual task. These options allows to schedule group tasks (more about it you can read in the [CFS group scheduling](http://lwn.net/Articles/240474/)). We can see that we assign the `alloc_size` variables which represent size based on amount of the processors to allocate for the `sched_entity` and `cfs_rq` to the `2 * nr_cpu_ids * sizeof(void **)` expression with `kzalloc`:

```C
ptr = (unsigned long)kzalloc(alloc_size, GFP_NOWAIT);
 
#ifdef CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED
        root_task_group.se = (struct sched_entity **)ptr;
        ptr += nr_cpu_ids * sizeof(void **);

        root_task_group.cfs_rq = (struct cfs_rq **)ptr;
        ptr += nr_cpu_ids * sizeof(void **);
#endif
        
```

The `sched_entity` is struture which defined in the [include/linux/sched.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/sched.h) and used by the scheduler to keep track of process accounting. The `cfs_rq` presents [run queue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_queue). So, you can see that we allocated space with size `alloc_size` for the run queue and scheduler entity of the `root_task_group`. The `root_task_group` is an instance of the `task_group` structure from the [kernel/sched/sched.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/sched/sched.h) which contains task group related information:

```C
struct task_group {
    ...
    ...
    struct sched_entity **se;
    struct cfs_rq **cfs_rq;
    ...
    ...
}
```

The root task group is the task group which belongs every task in system. As we allocated space for the root task group scheduler entity and runqueue, we go over all possible CPUs (`cpu_possible_mask` bitmap) and allocate zeroed memory from a particular memory node with the `kzalloc_node` function for the `load_balance_mask` `percpu` variable:

```C
DECLARE_PER_CPU(cpumask_var_t, load_balance_mask);
```

Here `cpumask_var_t` is the `cpumask_t` with one difference: `cpumask_var_t` is allocated only `nr_cpu_ids` bits when the `cpumask_t` always has `NR_CPUS` bits (more about `cpumask` you can read in the [CPU masks](http://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Concepts/cpumask.html) part). As you can see:

```C
#ifdef CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK
    for_each_possible_cpu(i) {
        per_cpu(load_balance_mask, i) = (cpumask_var_t)kzalloc_node(
                cpumask_size(), GFP_KERNEL, cpu_to_node(i));
    }
#endif
```

this code depends on the `CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK` configuration option. This configuration options says to use dynamic allocation for `cpumask`, instead of putting it on the stack. All groups have to be able to rely on the amount of CPU time. With the call of the two following functions:

```C
init_rt_bandwidth(&def_rt_bandwidth,
                  global_rt_period(), global_rt_runtime());
init_dl_bandwidth(&def_dl_bandwidth,
                  global_rt_period(), global_rt_runtime());
```

we initialize bandwidth management for the `SCHED_DEADLINE` real-time tasks. These functions initializes `rt_bandwidth` and `dl_bandwidth` structures which are store information about maximum `deadline` bandwith of the system. For example, let's look on the implementation of the `init_rt_bandwidth` function:

```C
void init_rt_bandwidth(struct rt_bandwidth *rt_b, u64 period, u64 runtime)
{
        rt_b->rt_period = ns_to_ktime(period);
        rt_b->rt_runtime = runtime;

        raw_spin_lock_init(&rt_b->rt_runtime_lock);

        hrtimer_init(&rt_b->rt_period_timer,
                     CLOCK_MONOTONIC, HRTIMER_MODE_REL);
        rt_b->rt_period_timer.function = sched_rt_period_timer;
}
```

It takes three parameters:

* address of the `rt_bandwidth` structure which contains information about the allocated and consumed quota within a period;
* `period` - period over which real-time task bandwidth enforcement is measured in `us`;
* `runtime` - part of the period that we allow tasks to run in `us`.

As `period` and `runtime` we pass result of the `global_rt_period` and `global_rt_runtime` functions. Which are `1s` second and and `0.95s` by default. The `rt_bandwidth` structure defined in the [kernel/sched/sched.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/sched/sched.h) and looks:

```C
struct rt_bandwidth {
        raw_spinlock_t          rt_runtime_lock;
        ktime_t                 rt_period;
        u64                     rt_runtime;
        struct hrtimer          rt_period_timer;
};
```

As you can see, it contains `runtime` and `period` and also two following fields:

* `rt_runtime_lock` - [spinlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinlock) for the `rt_time` protection;
* `rt_period_timer` - [high-resolution kernel timer](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/timers/hrtimers.txt) for unthrottled of real-time tasks.

So, in the `init_rt_bandwidth` we initialize `rt_bandwidth` period and runtime with the given parameters, initialize the spinlock and high-resolution time. In the next step, depends on the enabled [SMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing), we make initialization of the root domain:

```C
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	init_defrootdomain();
#endif
```

The real-time scheduler requires global resources to make scheduling decision. But unfortenatelly scalability bottlenecks appear as the number of CPUs increase. The concept of root domains was introduced for improving scalability. The linux kernel provides special mechanism for assigning a set of CPUs and memory nodes to a set of task and it is called - `cpuset`. If a `cpuset` contains non-overlapping with other `cpuset` CPUs, it is `exclusive cpuset`. Each exclusive cpuset defines an isolated domain or `root domain` of CPUs partitioned from other cpusets or CPUs. A `root domain` presented by the `struct root_domain` from the [kernel/sched/sched.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/sched/sched.h) in the linux kernel and its main purpose is to narrow the scope of the global variables to per-domain variables and all real-time scheduling decisions are made only within the scope of a root domain. That's all about it, but we will see more details about it in the chapter about scheduling about real-time scheduler.

After `root domain` initialization, we make initialization of the bandwidth for the real-time tasks of the root task group as we did it above: 

```C
#ifdef CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED
	init_rt_bandwidth(&root_task_group.rt_bandwidth,
			global_rt_period(), global_rt_runtime());
#endif
```

In the next step, depends on the `CONFIG_CGROUP_SCHED` kernel configuration option we initialze the `siblings` and `children` lists of the root task group. As we can read from the documentation, the `CONFIG_CGROUP_SCHED` is:

```
This option allows you to create arbitrary task groups using the "cgroup" pseudo
filesystem and control the cpu bandwidth allocated to each such task group.
```

As we finished with the lists initialization, we can see the call of the `autogroup_init` function:

```C
#ifdef CONFIG_CGROUP_SCHED
         list_add(&root_task_group.list, &task_groups);
         INIT_LIST_HEAD(&root_task_group.children);
         INIT_LIST_HEAD(&root_task_group.siblings);
         autogroup_init(&init_task);
#endif
```

which initializes automatic process group scheduling.

After this we are going through the all `possible` cpu (you can remember that `possible` CPUs store in the `cpu_possible_mask` bitmap of possible CPUs that can ever be available in the system) and initialize a `runqueue` for each possible cpu:

```C
for_each_possible_cpu(i) {
    struct rq *rq;
    ...
    ...
    ...
```

Each processor has its own locking and individual runqueue. All runnalble tasks are stored in an active array and indexed according to its priority. When a process consumes its time slice, it is moved to an expired array. All of these arras are stored in the special structure which names is `runqueu`. As there are no global lock and runqueu, we are going through the all possible CPUs and initialize runqueue for the every cpu. The `runque` is presented by the `rq` structure in the linux kernel which defined in the [kernel/sched/sched.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/sched/sched.h).

```C
rq = cpu_rq(i);
raw_spin_lock_init(&rq->lock);
rq->nr_running = 0;
rq->calc_load_active = 0;
rq->calc_load_update = jiffies + LOAD_FREQ;
init_cfs_rq(&rq->cfs);
init_rt_rq(&rq->rt);
init_dl_rq(&rq->dl);
rq->rt.rt_runtime = def_rt_bandwidth.rt_runtime;
```

Here we get the runque for the every CPU with the `cpu_rq` macto which returns `runqueues` percpu variable and start to initialize it with runqueu lock, number of running tasks, `calc_load` relative fields (`calc_load_active` and `calc_load_update`) which are used in the reckoning of a CPU load and initialization of the completely fair, real-time and deadline related fields in a runqueue. After this we initialize `cpu_load` array with zeros and set the last load update tick to the `jiffies` variable which determines the number of time ticks (cycles), since the system boot:

```C
for (j = 0; j < CPU_LOAD_IDX_MAX; j++)
    rq->cpu_load[j] = 0;

rq->last_load_update_tick = jiffies;
```

where `cpu_load` keeps history of runqueue loads in the past, for now `CPU_LOAD_IDX_MAX` is 5. In the next step we fill `runqueue` fields which are related to the [SMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing), but we will not cover they in this part. And in the end of the loop we initialize high-resolution timer for the give `runqueue` and set the `iowait` (more about it in the separate part about scheduler) number:

```C
init_rq_hrtick(rq);
atomic_set(&rq->nr_iowait, 0);
```

Now we came out from the `for_each_possible_cpu` loop and the next we need to set load weight for the `init` task with the `set_load_weight` function.  Weight of process is calculated through its dynamic priority which is static priority + scheduling class of the process. After this we increase memory usage counter of the memory descriptor of the `init` process and set scheduler class for the current process:

```C
atomic_inc(&init_mm.mm_count);
current->sched_class = &fair_sched_class;
```

And make current process (it will be the first `init` process) `idle` and update the value of the `calc_load_update` with the 5 seconds interval:

```C
init_idle(current, smp_processor_id());
calc_load_update = jiffies + LOAD_FREQ;
```

So, the `init` process will be runned, when there will no other candidates (as it first process in the system). In the end we just set `scheduler_running` variable:

```C
scheduler_running = 1;
```

That's all. Linux kernel scheduler is initialized. Of course, we missed many different details and explanations here, because we need to know and understand how different concepts (like process and process groups, runqueue, rcu and etc...) works in the linux kernel , but we took a short look on the scheduler initialization process. All other details we will look in the separate part which will be fully dedicated to the scheduler. 

Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is the end of the eighth part about the linux kernel initialization process. In this part, we looked on the initialization process of the scheduler and we will continue in the next part to dive in the linux kernel initialization process and will see initialization of the [RCU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update) and many more.

and other initialization stuff in the next part.
