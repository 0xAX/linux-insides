===============

Series of posts about linux kernel.

**Goal is simple** - to share my modest knowledge about linux kernel internals and help people who are interested in low-level stuff and linux kernel as me.

**Questions/Suggestions**: Feel free about any questions or suggestions by pinging me at twitter [@0xAX](https://twitter.com/0xAX), adding [issue](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-internals/issues/new) or just drop me [email](anotherworldofworld@gmail.com).

**Contributions**: Feel free to create issues or create pull-requests if you find issues or my English is poor.
