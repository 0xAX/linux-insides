linux-insides
===============

A book-in-progress about the linux kernel and its insides.

**The goal is simple** - to share my modest knowledge about the insides of the linux kernel and help people who are interested in linux kernel insides, and other low-level subject matter. Feel free to go through the book [Start here](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/SUMMARY.md)
