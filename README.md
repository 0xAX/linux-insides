linux-insides
===============

A series of posts about the linux kernel and its insides.

**The goal is simple** - to share my modest knowledge about the internals of the linux kernel and help people who are interested in the linux kernel internals, and other low-level subject matter.

**Questions/Suggestions**: Feel free about any questions or suggestions by pinging me at twitter [@0xAX](https://twitter.com/0xAX), adding [issue](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-internals/issues/new) or just drop me [email](mailto:anotherworldofworld@gmail.com).
