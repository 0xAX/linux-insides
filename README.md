# Linux insides

This repository contains a book-in-progress about the Linux kernel and its insides.

The goal of this project is simple – to share knowledge about the Linux kernel internals and related low-level topics. If you’re curious about what’s under the hood, see the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I started writing this series when the latest version of the kernel was `3.18`. A lot has changed since then, and I am in progress of updating the content to reflect modern kernels (v6.16+). I’ll continue revising the posts as the kernel evolves.

## Requirements

- Prior knowledge about the [Assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)
- Proficiency with the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
- Additionally, you can find lots of useful information about x86_64 processors in [Intel Software Developer Manuals](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html)

> [!TIP]
> You can get started with Assembler with my other series of posts about the [Assembly programming](https://github.com/0xAX/asm).

## Translations

Thanks to the volunteers, the posts about Linux are translated into different languages.
