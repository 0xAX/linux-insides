linux-internals
===============

A serie of posts about the linux kernel.

**The goal is simple** - to share my modest knowledge about the internals of the linux kernel and help people who are interested in the linux kernel, and other low-level subject matter.

**Questions/Suggestions**: Feel free about any questions or suggestions by pinging me at twitter [@0xAX](https://twitter.com/0xAX), adding [issue](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-internals/issues/new) or just drop me [email](anotherworldofworld@gmail.com).

**Contributions**: Feel free to create issues or create pull-requests if you find any issues or my English is poor.

**Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before pushing any changes.**
