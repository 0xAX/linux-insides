Data Structures in the Linux Kernel
================================================================================

Doubly linked list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linux kernel provides its own doubly linked list implementation which you can find in the [include/linux/list.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/list.h). We will start `Data Structures in the Linux kernel` from the doubly linked list data structure. Why? Because it is very popular in the kernel, just try to [search](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=list_head)

First of all let's look on the main structure:

```C
struct list_head {
	struct list_head *next, *prev;
};
```

You can note that it is different from many lists implementations which you could see. For example this doubly linked list structure from the [glib](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/):

```C
struct GList {
  gpointer data;
  GList *next;
  GList *prev;
};
```

Usually a linked list structure contains a pointer to the item. Linux kernel implementation of the list does not. So the main question is - `where does the list store the data?`. The actual implementation of lists in the kernel is - `Intrusive list`. An intrusive linked list does not contain data in its nodes - A node just contains pointers to the next and previous node and list nodes part of the data that are added to the list. This makes the data structure generic, so it does not care about entry data type anymore.

For example:

```C
struct nmi_desc {
    spinlock_t lock;
    struct list_head head;
};
```

Let's look at some examples, how `list_head` is used in the kernel. As I already wrote about, there are many, really many different places where lists are used in the kernel. Let's look for example in miscellaneous character drivers. Misc character drivers API from the [drivers/char/misc.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/char/misc.c) for writing small drivers for handling simple hardware or virtual devices. This drivers share major number:

```C
#define MISC_MAJOR              10
```

but has own minor number. For example you can see it with:

```
ls -l /dev |  grep 10
crw-------   1 root root     10, 235 Mar 21 12:01 autofs
drwxr-xr-x  10 root root         200 Mar 21 12:01 cpu
crw-------   1 root root     10,  62 Mar 21 12:01 cpu_dma_latency
crw-------   1 root root     10, 203 Mar 21 12:01 cuse
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root         100 Mar 21 12:01 dri
crw-rw-rw-   1 root root     10, 229 Mar 21 12:01 fuse
crw-------   1 root root     10, 228 Mar 21 12:01 hpet
crw-------   1 root root     10, 183 Mar 21 12:01 hwrng
crw-rw----+  1 root kvm      10, 232 Mar 21 12:01 kvm
crw-rw----   1 root disk     10, 237 Mar 21 12:01 loop-control
crw-------   1 root root     10, 227 Mar 21 12:01 mcelog
crw-------   1 root root     10,  59 Mar 21 12:01 memory_bandwidth
crw-------   1 root root     10,  61 Mar 21 12:01 network_latency
crw-------   1 root root     10,  60 Mar 21 12:01 network_throughput
crw-r-----   1 root kmem     10, 144 Mar 21 12:01 nvram
brw-rw----   1 root disk      1,  10 Mar 21 12:01 ram10
crw--w----   1 root tty       4,  10 Mar 21 12:01 tty10
crw-rw----   1 root dialout   4,  74 Mar 21 12:01 ttyS10
crw-------   1 root root     10,  63 Mar 21 12:01 vga_arbiter
crw-------   1 root root     10, 137 Mar 21 12:01 vhci
```

Now let's look how lists are used in the misc device drivers. First of all let's look on `miscdevice` structure:

```C
struct miscdevice
{
      int minor;
      const char *name;
      const struct file_operations *fops;
      struct list_head list;
      struct device *parent;
      struct device *this_device;
      const char *nodename;
      mode_t mode;
};
```

We can see the fourth field in the `miscdevice` structure - `list` which is list of registered devices. In the beginning of the source code file we can see definition of the:

```C
static LIST_HEAD(misc_list);
```

which expands to definition of the variables with `list_head` type:

```C
#define LIST_HEAD(name) \
	struct list_head name = LIST_HEAD_INIT(name)
```

and initializes it with the `LIST_HEAD_INIT` macro which set previous and next entries:

```C
#define LIST_HEAD_INIT(name) { &(name), &(name) }
```

Now let's look on the `misc_register` function which registers a miscellaneous device. At the start it initializes `miscdevice->list` with the `INIT_LIST_HEAD` function:

```C
INIT_LIST_HEAD(&misc->list);
```

which does the same that `LIST_HEAD_INIT` macro:

```C
static inline void INIT_LIST_HEAD(struct list_head *list)
{
	list->next = list;
	list->prev = list;
}
```

In the next step after device created with the `device_create` function we add it to the miscellaneous devices list with:

```
list_add(&misc->list, &misc_list);
```

Kernel `list.h` provides this API for the addition of new entry to the list. Let's look on it's implementation:

```C
static inline void list_add(struct list_head *new, struct list_head *head)
{
	__list_add(new, head, head->next);
}
```

It just calls internal function `__list_add` with the 3 given parameters:

* new  - new entry;
* head - list head after which will be inserted new item;
* head->next - next item after list head.

Implementation of the `__list_add` is pretty simple:

```C
static inline void __list_add(struct list_head *new,
			      struct list_head *prev,
			      struct list_head *next)
{
	next->prev = new;
	new->next = next;
	new->prev = prev;
	prev->next = new;
}
```

Here we set new item between `prev` and `next`. So `misc` list which we defined at the start with the `LIST_HEAD_INIT` macro will contain previous and next pointers to the `miscdevice->list`.

There is still only one question how to get list's entry. There is special special macro for this point:

```C
#define list_entry(ptr, type, member) \
	container_of(ptr, type, member)
```

which gets three parameters:

* ptr - the structure list_head pointer;
* type - structure type;
* member - the name of the list_head within the struct; 

For example:

```C
const struct miscdevice *p = list_entry(v, struct miscdevice, list)
```

After this we can access to the any `miscdevice` field with `p->minor` or `p->name` and etc... Let's look on the `list_entry` implementation:

```C
#define list_entry(ptr, type, member) \
	container_of(ptr, type, member)
```

As we can see it just calls `container_of` macro with the same arguments. For the first look `container_of` looks strange:

```C
#define container_of(ptr, type, member) ({                      \
    const typeof( ((type *)0)->member ) *__mptr = (ptr);    \
    (type *)( (char *)__mptr - offsetof(type,member) );})
```

First of all you can note that it consists from two expressions in curly brackets. Compiler will evaluate the whole block in the curly braces and use the value of the last expression.

For example:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int i = 0;
	printf("i = %d\n", ({++i; ++i;}));
	return 0;
}
```

will print `2`.

The next point is `typeof`, it's simple. As you can understand from its name, it just returns the type of the given variable. When I first saw the implementation of the `container_of` macro, the strangest thing for me was the zero in the `((type *)0)` expression. Actually this pointer magic calculates the offset of the given field from the address of the structure, but as we have `0` here, it will be just a zero offset alongwith the field width. Let's look at a simple example:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

struct s {
        int field1;
        char field2;
		char field3;
};

int main() {
	printf("%p\n", &((struct s*)0)->field3);
	return 0;
}
```

will print `0x5`.

The next offsetof macro calculates offset from the beginning of the structure to the given structure's field. Its implementation is very similar to the previous code:

```C
#define offsetof(TYPE, MEMBER) ((size_t) &((TYPE *)0)->MEMBER)
```

Let's summarize all about `container_of` macro. `container_of` macro returns address of the structure by the given address of the structure's field with `list_head` type, the name of the structure field with `list_head` type and type of the container structure. At the first line this macro declares the `__mptr` pointer which points to the field of the structure that `ptr` points to and assigns it to the `ptr`. Now `ptr` and `__mptr` point to the same address. Technically we don't need this line but its useful for type checking. First line ensures that that given structure (`type` parameter) has a member called `member`. In the second line it calculates offset of the field from the structure with the `offsetof` macro and subtracts it from the structure address. That's all.

Of course `list_add` and `list_entry` is not only functions which provides `<linux/list.h>`. Implementation of the doubly linked list provides the following API:

* list_add
* list_add_tail
* list_del
* list_replace
* list_move
* list_is_last
* list_empty
* list_cut_position
* list_splice

and many more.
