# Contributing

**Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this free series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request).

## Create an issue 

If you have any improvement ideas, notice a missing feature or a bug, create a GitHub issue by clicking **Issues -> New issue** in GitHub. Make sure to fill the issue template with a detailed description of the bug or suggested improvements. Provide proper argumentation and screenshots, if necessary.

If you find any existing issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

## Open a pull request

If you want to directly contribute to the project, create a pull reguest with the suggested changes. To do so:

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository).

2. Make changes on your local copy of the forked repository.

3. Commit and push the changes to GitHub. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Don't forget to update your fork. Since many contributors may be working on the same content based on the `master` branch, some merge conflicts may occur. Remember to rebase with `master` every time before pushing your changes and make sure your branch doesn't have any conflicts with `master`. If you run into any merge conflicts, read the [Resolve merge conflicts](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) tutorial to learn how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

4. Open a pull request in GitHub. Fill the pull request template with the reason and description for the provided changes. Link your pull request with the existing issue, if applicable. After submitting your PR, wait for the review from the project maintainers.

## Review and approval process

After you submit your PR, wait for the review. The project maintainers will evaluate your changes and provide feedback either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. Address the review suggestions and comments as soon as you can. If your PR looks good, the maintainers approve and merge it.
